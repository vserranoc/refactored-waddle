**##ABOUT THE PROJECT**


**OBJECTIVE**

One of the most relevant topics our days is sentiment analysis, with this tool we analyzed the sentiments derived from the conversations that occur on Twitter. Sentiment Analysis is a field from Natural Language Processing with the objective to learn and identify behaviors on the social network Twitter. This process works with three types of sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral opinions) about products, services, persons, organizations, or any other kind of entity about a specific text. With this tool, the user will be able to evaluate the content from trending topics or tweets. Also, will be able to filter, and order according to the feeling about one product.

For this project we will be applying two types of techniques: 

Unsupervised Learning

Supervised Learning

**CLIENT**

This tool is focused on MKT agencies, businesses that want to monitor the reputation or brand image of their products, or any other user that wants to know about trends or product behaviors.
The client can order in-depth customized reports about any specific topic or product. The reports will contain current and trend charts, key concepts, associated with the requested topic. These reports will be broken by days, weeks, months.
